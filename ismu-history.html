									<p>The Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education "Irkutsk
										State Medical University" of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation
										(hereinafter - IGMU) is the first-born of higher medical education in the East of
										Russia and one of the oldest higher educational institutions in Siberia. It was
										opened on August 26, 1919 in the form of a medical department at the Faculty of
										Physics and Mathematics of Irkutsk State University. On January 20, 1920, the
										medical department was separated into an independent educational and administrative
										unit - the Medical Faculty of Irkutsk State University.</p>

									<p>The elite of the Kazan Medical School stood at the origins of IGMU: Professor N.D.
										Bushmakin – the largest anatomist and organizer, rector of the university;
										Professor N.T. Shevyakov - a world-renowned biologist; Professor N.T. Sinakevich -
										a first-hand surgeon; Professor V.A. Donskoy - the founder of the Museum of
										Pathology and others. In the first year of the faculty's opening, the departments
										of normal anatomy with a museum and histology with a laboratory, pathological
										anatomy, bacteriology, operative surgery and topographic anatomy with a museum,
										general pathology, medical diagnostics (propaedeutics of internal diseases) began
										to function, the organization of the department of hospital surgery with a clinic
										was initiated. In 1921, departments with clinics began to function: obstetric and
										gynecological, faculty therapeutic and surgical with an X-ray room, propaedeutic
										and surgical with a laboratory, skin and venereal, eye diseases, nervous and mental
										diseases with an X-ray room, laboratory and library, physiology.

									<p>In 1921, a scientific medical society was organized at the Faculty of Medicine, in
										which, in addition to faculty members, practical doctors of the city and region
										took part. In 1922, the I.I. Mechnikov Student Scientific Society was established
										under the leadership of Professors A.A. Melkikh, V.G. Shipachev and O.I. Bronstein.
										Since 1923, the Irkutsk Medical Journal has been published.

										In 1925, the postgraduate school was established. The first graduate students were
										S.N. Sinakevich, T.A. Larionova and E.L. Mikhelson. A major event in the life of
										the faculty was the organization and holding in Irkutsk of the first congress of
										doctors of Eastern Siberia (1924).

										The Medical Faculty of the university occupied a large share in terms of personnel
										potential, scientific products and training. In 1928, the faculty had 24
										professors, 46 associate professors and assistants, 21 residents and 11 graduate
										students. Out of 163 scientific papers published by the university – 40 papers on
										medical topics.</p>
									<p>In 1929, a radical restructuring of higher education began to take place in the
										country. Medical universities were transferred from the Narkompros system to branch
										People's Commissariats. By this time, the internal need for transformation into an
										independent unit had also matured at the medical faculty. For this reason, in the
										spring of 1930, the Medical Faculty of Irkutsk University was separated into an
										independent institute and transferred to the People's Commissariat of Health.</p>

										assessment of the quality of training of specialists, conducted by the State
										Inspectorate for the certification of educational institutions of the State
										Committee of the Russian Federation for Higher Education. According to the
										conclusion of the educational and methodological association for medical education,
										the university principle of education is implemented at the institute. Thus, the
										whole complex of qualities and characteristics made possible the transition of the
										medical institute (in May 1995) to a new status – "university".

										In 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017, IGMU underwent regular comprehensive
										performance evaluations and certification. As a result of the state accreditation
										of IGMU (2012), the status of the university was confirmed, the certificate of
										state accreditation was issued by the Federal Service for Supervision of Education
										and Science. The Federal Service for Supervision in the Field of Education and
										Science has issued a license to carry out educational activities for the right to

										subsequent education on the basis of the attached separate structural subdivision
										of the Institute of Nursing Education.

										The IGMU has implemented and effectively operates a quality management system. In
										November 2011, IGMU successfully passed the certification check of the quality
										management system for compliance with the international quality standard ISO
										9001:2008 and the national standard GOST ISO 9001-2011. According to the results of
